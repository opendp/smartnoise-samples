    "\n",
    "[Dinur & Nissim (2003)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/773153.773173) roughly states that if too many queries on a database are answered too accurately, almost the entire database can be reconstructed from the answers to the queries. Before this fact was properly understood, statistical releases from databases were typically limited in ad-hoc ways. For example, an interactive querying system (in which analysts propose their own queries) may not allow queries that clearly single out individual elements of the data set. Similarly, in a one-shot release (e.g. the U.S. Census Bureau releasing statistical tables) the releasing party may decide not to release statistics on groups with fewer than some fixed number of elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Releasing statistics in a differentially private manner has been posed as a principled way to ensure the privacy of individuals included in a database and prevent database reconstruction. Notably, the U.S. Census is moving to use differentially private algorithms to perform statistical releases for the 2020 Census, for fear that their old methods of privatization (a.k.a. statistical disclosure limitation) are not sufficient to prevent database reconstruction. See [Garfinkel, Abowd, Martindale (2018)](https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3295691&ftid=2020934&dwn=1) for more information. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will focus on the one-shot release model and simulate the process of a data owner releasing aggregate statistics from a sensitive database, both with and without differential privacy. We will then attempt to reconstruct the original database from each set of releases."

    "### Statistical Release and Reconstruction Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "We are nearly ready to consider an actual set of statistical releases and how this can enable a reconstruction attack, but it will be useful to first consider some details of our attacker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attacker's goal is to reconstruct the `income` column as closely as possible (by some definition of closeness), using a combination of the statistical releases and pre-existing knowledge of the database. We will assume for now that the attacker has no pre-existing knowledge, and thus bases their reconstruction only on the statistical releases. Following [Garfinkel, Abowd, Martindale (2018)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3291276.3295691), we attempt to construct a database that is consistent with the releases using a SAT/SMT solver. We will be using [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), but other SAT/SMT solvers could serve the same purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z3 takes a boolean formula with associated variables and returns whether or not the formula is satisfiable; that is, whether or not there exists a set of variable values that makes the boolean formula `TRUE`. For example, let $A,B$ be boolean variables. The formula $A \\land B$ is satisfiable because it is true if $A = B = TRUE$. The formula $A \\land B \\land \\neg B$ is not satisfiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea can be applied to finding a database that satisfies a set of statistical releases. Say we know that a subgroup has 3 elements, $\\{i_1, i_2, i_3\\}$ with median income $50,000$, mean income $60,000$, and min income $0$. Note that, because elements within a subgroup are equivalent with respect to the subset of variables that dedine the subset, we are free to index however we wish within the subset. We choose to enforce the element values to be montonically non-decreasing in the index. So, we can represent each statistical release as a statement we'll call an `application`: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (i_1 \\leq i_2 \\leq i_3) \\land (i_1 = 0) \\land (i_2 = 50,000) \\land \\left( (i_1 + i_2 + i_3)/3 = 60,000 \\right). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we get satisfying values of $i_1, i_2$ for free and can find $i_3 = 130,000$ by plugging in $i_1, i_2$ to the last equation. So $\\{0, 50,000, 130,000\\}$ is a database that is consistent with our statistical release.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, as long as the set of statistical releases is internally consistent (results do not contradict one another), Z3 should be able to find at least one satisfying assignment.\n"
