# Sample Attack Notebooks

## Python Notebooks 
The following notebooks use the SmartNoise Core Rust library and validator through Python bindings.

* [Simple Attack](https://github.com/opendp/smartnoise-samples/blob/master/attacks/simple_attack.ipynb): Examine perhaps the simplest possible attack on an individual's private data and what the SmartNoise library can do to mitigate it. 
  - Notebook: [`simple_attack.ipynb`](https://github.com/opendifferentialprivacy/smartnoise-samples/blob/master/attacks/simple_attack.ipynb)
* [Database Reconstruction Attacks](https://github.com/opendp/smartnoise-samples/blob/master/attacks/reconstruction/reconstruction.ipynb) This notebook focuses on the one-shot release model and simulates the process of a data owner releasing aggregate statistics from a sensitive database, both with and without differential privacy. We will then attempt to reconstruct the original database from each set of releases.
