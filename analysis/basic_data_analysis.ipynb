    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The core WhiteNoise library is made up of two key pieces; the runtime and the validator. The runtime is made up of low-level algorithms and operations. The validator contains logic for combining runtime elements into more complex operations, as well as methods for determining whether or not a computation is differentially private. If an analysis plan is deemed to produce data that are not differentially private, the validator will not allow this analysis to run. Importantly, this is done independent of the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether or not a set of computations produces differentially private data relies on a set of properties of the data. These properties can be statically determined (without touching the actual data) and can be updated at each step of the analysis. One pair of common properties is `lower/upper`. For a differentially private mean, for example, the validator requires the input data to have defined lower and upper bounds. An analyst can ensure that `lower/upper` are set with the `clamp` component, which clamps data to a given range.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we have access to the PUMS codebook, and thus know some basic information about the possible values for the variables in the data. This is a convenient way to have reasonable baselines for properties like `lower/upper`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common property is `n`, an estimate of the sample size of the data in question. In general, this could be based on true knowledge of the data, an educated guess, or we could produce it via a differentially private process. We know, by construction of the data set, that this is a 1,000 person sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another property is `nullity`, whether or not the validator can guarantee that results are not null. We will see what it looks like for both the `lower/upper` and `nullity` properties to change within an analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with `lower/upper`."
